Question 1 of 3: Do the Investor Owned long term care facilities on average make
more net income than the Not for Profit long term care facilities?

Rationale: This should help identify if the type of ownership control impacts
how profitable the long term care facility will be.

Note: This compares the columns “NET_INCOME” and “TYPE_CNTRL” from 
ltcfprofitability.

Limitations: None. No missing values in any of the relevant columns.

Question 2 of 3: Are the total hours worked by registered nurses dependent on

significant factor in how many hours are worked by the registered nurses.

Question 3 of 3: Is a long term care facility dependent on the total patient

Rationale: This should help identify whether the patient census days are a
